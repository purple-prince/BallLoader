A fun, colorful, infinitely-repeating SwiftUI loader animation inspired by [this one]([https://www.google.com](https://dribbble.com/shots/20298723-Loader-animation)).

Supports a few customizable parameters:

- Duration
- Primary & Secondary Colors
- Bounce Effect, Spring Effect


Known Issues:
  - Due to a numerically derived animation curve, short animation durations can be inaccurate


Future Plans:
  - More customization options (shapes, timing curves, reversing)
  - Substitute ease-out-in numerical derivation with a continuous function to fix lagging under very short durations
